Title: Optimization methods applied to neural networks for fraud detection in credit card transactions

Abstract: In this project, it is intended to study optimization methods, especially stochastic algorithms, applied to the training of neural networks. In a recent paper proposed by E. G. Birgin, L. F. Bueno and J. M. Martı́nez, “On the complexity of solving feasibility
problems with regularized models”, 2020, a first-order algorithm was presented with good complexity results for least squares problems. One of this project's research main point is to develop a stochastic version of this algorithm. The performance of the studied algorithms will be analyzed when applied to fraud detection in credit card operations using Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection database.
